### Manually flush cache with Ajax

In manual mode, Quick Flush Cache module allows store admin to clean cache without being redirected to another page. 

Because Ajax is supported, the cache is flushed after one click while you keep staying on the current page.

### Automatically flush cache 

In the automatic mode, the cache is automatically flushed right when the page is reloaded. 

For example, when the store admin saves any updated, the page is refreshed and the cache is flushed at the same time. 

The store admin does not need to click on any button. All flushing process is activated automatically.

Quick Flush Cache also allows stores to reindex easily. 

When you get a notification that one or more indexers are invalid, you can do reindexing immediately by clicking on the Reindex Now button. This process is practised without any redirection,
